I don’t want to stop you having fun, Eric, but some of this is already
done for you. From:

  https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts

you can download CSV and JSON versions of the whole metadata catalogue, and:

  http://ota.ox.ac.uk/tcp/
 
has a browsable sortable HTML table with all that data. Perhaps not all
the data categories you want. The ability of jQuery datatables to cope
with 60000 rows of data is rather awesome.

and of course HTML for all the texts is available from http://ota.ox.ac.uk/tcp/ too.

I did try putting up an eXist database with all the texts for searching,
but couldn’t justify maintaining it to myself. Wolfgang Meier did a
better job of this, but there isn’t enough space in the margin to
remember the URL for that.

the more text analysis the better, natch :-}
