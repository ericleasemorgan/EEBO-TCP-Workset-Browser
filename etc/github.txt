There are two shell scripts at

  https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts

graball.sh and cloneall.sh. The first just hoovers up the XML files, the
second clones each repository from Github.

I would recommend keeping up with changes “”properly” by using Git, if
you’re a resupplier, as then you’ll get corrections. For example, a few
days ago I changed all the ECCO files so that the page image pointers go
to Jisc Historical Books, not Chadwick-Healey (well, you see, C-H dont
have those images……)

My colleagues in the Bodleian (not “Boolean”, mr apple autocorrect)
Libraries make the collection available with a DOI of
10.5287/bodleian:s4655j198

Anyone who wants the dark EEBO (phase 2) collection as  TEI P5 in the
same format will have to contact me offline.
